                    <p>It is a heritage we are proud of, which helps to define and inspire the way we operate today.
                        Yardley’s story is uplifting and compelling, sets us apart, and is the perfect foundation on
                        which to consolidate our business</p>

                    <p>Contemporary products such as refreshing body sprays, body lotions, roll-on’s and hair creams
                        have joined more traditional essentials such as talcum powders and soaps.</p>

                    <p>Consistency has been the main reason people trust us. That, and of course, the fact that quality
                        never goes out of fashion.</p>

                <p>Just as character traits distinguish a person, so core values define a brand. The five core values
